# Light Manager Air Integration for Home Assistant

A Home Assistant custom integration for the jbmedia's Light Manager Air.

# Credits

Original project: https://github.com/kmifka/hass_lmair

Maintained and extended by: MarioIR2001

## Key Features

- **Automatic device discovery** on your local network

  - **Lights** (including dimming)
  - **Blinds/Covers**
  - **Markers**
  - **Scenes**
-  **Last Radio Signal sensor**
    -   Protocol detection
    -   Raw code
    -   Repeat counter

- **Radio reception**: Receive 433 MHz and 868 MHz radio signals
- **Marker status updates**: Read an control markers as a switch in Home Assistant
- **Weather data**: Integration of connected weather channels
- **Cover Positioning**: Configure covers to display and set their current position based on opening and closing times.
- **Marker mapping**: Use markers as state proxies for stateless devices.
- **Ignore Zones**: Configure zones to be ignored in Home Assistant

## Installation

### Option 1: Manual Installation

1. Copy the `light_manager_air` folder to the `custom_components` directory in your Home Assistant configuration folder.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Add the integration via the UI:
   Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration** and search for "Light Manager Air".

### Option 2: Installation via HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)

1. **Ensure HACS is Installed**
   If you don’t have HACS installed, follow the [HACS installation guide](https://hacs.xyz/docs/use/).

2. **Add the Custom Repository**
   - Open Home Assistant and navigate to **HACS** → **Integrations**.
   - Click the **three dots menu** in the top-right corner and select **Custom repositories**.
   - Add the following repository URL:
     ```
     https://github.com/kmifka/hass_lmair
     ```
   - Select **Integration** as the category.
   - Click **Add**.

3. **Install the Integration**
   - Search for "Light Manager Air" in the HACS integrations list.
   - Click **Install** to download and install the integration.

4. **Restart Home Assistant**
   to apply changes.

5. **Add the integration via the UI**:
   Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration** and search for "Light Manager Air".

## Important Notes on Unique Zone and Actuator Names

It is crucial that each combination of zone and actuator name in the Light Manager is unique, as these are used to generate entities in Home Assistant. If the names are not unique, only the first occurrence will be added to Home Assistant, and all subsequent entities will be skipped. Changes to zones or actuators in the Light Manager will result in duplicate or new entries in Home Assistant.

---

## Reloading devices and scenes after changes

When you add or rename zones, actuators, or scenes in the Light Manager Air, Home Assistant needs a reload to pick them up. The integration now exposes a service for this:

- Call service `light_manager_air.reload_fixtures` (optional data: `entry_id` if you have multiple instances) to refresh devices and entities from the Light Manager.
- Alternatively, go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Light Manager Air → Reload** in the UI.

The service performs a full config-entry reload, so entity IDs stay stable but new devices/scenes become available without reinstalling the integration.

## Configuration

### Polling Settings

The Light Manager Air relies on polling for updates because it does not support event-based communication. This integration allows you to adjust the polling intervals for:

1. **Marker Updates**: Updates the status of markers (Default: `5000 ms`).
2. **Radio Signals**: Checks for 433 MHz and 868 MHz signals (Default: `2000 ms`).
3. **Weather Updates**: Retrieves weather data from connected weather stations (Default: `300000 ms`).

You can customize these intervals to suit your needs or disable polling entirely if not required:

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**.
2. Locate the Light Manager Air integration and click **Options**.
3. Set your desired intervals or disable polling by uncheck the checkbox.

⚠️ **Warning**: Short intervals improve response times but may impact performance. Use default settings as a starting point and adjust based on your system's capabilities.

### Using Radio Bus Events for Automations

The Light Manager Air can receive radio bus events, which can be used to trigger automations in Home Assistant. The default entity ID for radio signals is `event.radio_signal`. Automations can be configured to listen for specific radio signals by using the event trigger. For example, you can set up a trigger in Home Assistant that listens for the `radio_signal` event with a specific code:

```yaml
triggers:
  - trigger: event
    event_type: radio_signal
    event_data:
      code: rfit_14734E8A
```

### Cover Timings

You can now configure covers to display their current position and set positions based on opening and closing times. To do this, add the following configuration to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
light_manager_air:
  cover_timings:
    - entity_id: "cover.jalousie"
      travel_up_time: 35.0  # Seconds for full opening
      travel_down_time: 32.0 # Seconds for full closing (optional)
      custom_stop_logic: true
```


The `custom_stop_logic` option means that the last sent command will be repeatedly sent to stop the actuator. This is particularly useful for actuators that do not have a native stop command or for those where the stop command does not work reliably.

### Marker Mapping

Markers can be used to map the states of actuators, which are by default stateless in the Light Manager Air. 

To ensure markers are updated when an actuator is operated, you need to configure the Light Manager in AirStudio. In the actuator management section of AirStudio, select the mapped marker in the "Marker | Sensor" column.

To configure marker mappings, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
light_manager_air:
  marker_mappings:
    - marker_id: 12
      entity_id: "light.garden_lights"
    - marker_id: 15
      entity_id: "cover.bedroom_blinds"
    - marker_id: 22
      entity_id: "light.dining_room"
    - marker_id: 30
      entity_id: "light.fountain_pump"
      invert: true
```

### Ignored Zones

You can configure zones to be ignored by adding them to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
light_manager_air:
  ignored_zones:
  - "Living Room"
  - "Garage"
  - "Scenes"
```

By adding "Scenes" to the `ignored_zones` list, all scenes will be ignored and not added to Home Assistant.

### Entity Type Conversion

Convert entities to different types using the `entity_conversions` configuration. This is useful for changing how entities are represented in Home Assistant:

```yaml
light_manager_air:
  entity_conversions:
    - zone_name: "Living Room"
      actuator_name: "Ceiling Light"
      target_type: "switch"
```
