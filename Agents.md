## Commit Guidelines

- Do NOT include "Generated with Claude Code" or similar notes in commit messages
- Commit messages should be clear, concise, and descriptive
- Use the imperative mood in commit messages (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
- No need for co-author attribution to Claude

## Code Style Guidelines

### General Principles
- Maintain clean, readable, and consistent code

### Comments

- Add comments only when necessary to explain complex logic
- Don't comment obvious code

### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive names for classes, methods, and variables
- Follow Python naming conventions:
  - snake_case for methods and variables
  - CamelCase for classes
  - UPPER_CASE for constants
